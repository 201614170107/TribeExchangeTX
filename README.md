# TX TRIBE EXCHANGE
Modular, Scalable, Decentralized Exchange

## Summary
TX is a financial exchange that runs entirely within the Ethereum Virtual Machine. A set of programs (or Smart Contracts) contain all of the computation and data necessary to run a full scale double-auction for Ethereum based Digital Assets. This means Startups can spin up their own exchange that runs completely autonomously and with zero cost.
